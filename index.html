      document.getElementById("chapterText").innerHTML = `Joe: Hello, welcome to our book review of The Hidden Inequities in Labor-Based Contract Grading, by Ellen C. Carillo, published in 2021. My name is Joe Schicke. I'm a PhD student at Texas Tech. We also have Sarah Faye and Jacob Weston, who are my fellow students in the program of Technical Communication and Rhetoric. In the introduction of Carillo’s book, she says she's moved to enter the discussion about labor-based grading contracts because of her commitment to her racially and linguistically diverse students, and the scholarship of Asao Inoue, Wonderful Faison, Carmen Kynard, Maya Poe and Vershawn Ashanti Young, as well as Inoue’s openness to critique from disability studies. So in Chapter 1, she states two assumptions of labor-based grading contracts: 1), that labor is a neutral measure and less inequitable a measure than quality for determining final course grades; and 2), that willingness to labor is enough to succeed within the labor-based grading contract ecology Inoue describes. These assumptions, for Carillo, do not take into account strongly enough the presence of students in our classrooms with disabilities, neurodivergence and socioeconomic barriers. Carillo says that students get disadvantaged “when willingness is conflated with ability” (14). She also quotes Ira Shor who points out that “Time is a luxury not all students have” (15). Sarah Faye from UC-Davis. 

Sarah: Chapter 1 was extremely helpful to me because it articulated some of the issues that I sensed in my contract, but I couldn't quite figure out what was going on that wasn't fully working. My contract was so helpful for a group of students and completely not helpful and stressful for another group of students. And if I have— if I'm honest, it was actually stressful to all students because even the students were on a very successful path, also had unexpected emergencies that, you know, created disruption in their ability to complete the work.

So really, my contract was problematic on all students and I particularly like the idea that Carillo brings up that we're not making changes to the assessment so that we are helping one little group of students — we're actually helping all students by doing those changes. As an example, I think it's in Chapter 1 that Carrillo brings up, Inoue’s contract where he has what he calls a gimme, which is a one-time possibility to break the rules of the contract for emergencies.

And Carrillo points out that the very fact that you have this gimme shows that we all know that our students were not going to be able to follow the rules of a strict contract. They will have emergencies, they will have things come up. So already, that's problematic, but then it's even worse because as Carillo points out, the gimme really places the able-bodied, neuro-normative students at the center of the contract because it has this assumption that, “Oh, of course all students will be able to complete the work on time. They just need this one time exception for extraordinary circumstances.” We’re all teaching, we all know that that is not the case. That's not the reality of what happens, right? So I really like the idea that we have to put disability at the center of assessment methods in a way, in order to help all our students.

I just want to do a quick example. I started recording my class meetings so that students who couldn't come to class because of a disability could still complete the in-class activities at home. But then I noticed that this is actually helping any student who can’t make it to class for whatever reason, right? So now there's no more need to discuss their reasons for not being in class or create individual accommodations. Any students who cannot make it to class can still complete the work, right? So we have more options and more possibilities. So focusing on disability actually helps everyone in our classes.

Jacob: So what I appreciate about the introduction in the first chapter of this are: I think Carillo does a really good job of centering this critique on the use of the term labor, and I think we can extend that even to the use of the term contract, right? That we're envisioning education through a neoliberal lens, right? We're imagining the work that students are doing as something they would do in a job, which is beneficial as a metaphor, but I think problematic at the same time. In my research piloting grading contracts at Texas Tech, one of the things that has become apparent to us is, what is the level of efficacy that students have to actually negotiate or understand these contracts, right? We can, as instructors go into this situation with as much compassion as possible and assume that students will advocate on their behalf. But since this is— tends to be a totally different assessment environment than what students are getting in a K-12 environment, and it's so new and unfamiliar, often they're not sure if they can say, “oh, I don't like this part, or, oh, I do like this part.” And I think that for me that's really the value of Carillo’s critique is that it's re-imagining grading contracts as a whole as opposed to viewing them just as a monolithic entity."`;
       } else if (title === 'Chapters 2 and 3') {
      document.getElementById("chapterText").innerHTML = `Jacob: Chapter 2, “Substituting One Standard for Another,” specifically critiques the fact that while labor-based grading removes an emphasis on quality, it replaces that with an emphasis on labor-as-time. While this discussion on labor-as-time appears in later chapters, here, Carillo is focused on the apparent objectivity which numerical data — for example, time spent reading, number of revisions done, etc. — provides. She continues that this objectivity can lead to the reification of, and definition for, the ideal, normative, able-bodied student, which is at odds with the reality of the actual students in our classrooms. Furthermore, she notes that things taken for granted — for instance, a student sitting still and paying attention in class — might actually constitute significant labor on the part of disabled or neurodiverse students.
      
      Chapter 3, “Labor-Based Contract Grading and Students' Mental Health,” focuses on the intersection of mental health issues, for example, anxiety and depression, with disabilities. Carillo notes the rise in anxiety and depression among college students in the past several years, and the increase in students seeking disability accommodations. However, she notes that while the number of students with disclosed disabilities has increased, there are many students with disabilities who do not disclose for multiple reasons. The second half of the chapter critiques the ethics of asking students with disabilities to adequately negotiate contracts in the classroom which accommodate their needs. While she does state that considering non-normative students in classroom negotiations could prove a beneficial chance to make visible disabilities, especially to able-bodied students — which is aligned with Inoue’s call for compassion within the classroom community — instructors must be careful not to further marginalize already marginalized groups.
      
      So, in light of these chapters, but specifically the part of Chapter 3 that explores Jay Timothy Dolmage’s critique of retrofitting — which is essentially the idea that we often accommodate disability by applying a metaphorical bandage to an issue instead of rethinking the issue holistically — how has this book changed either of your conceptions of contract grading or the possibilities afforded by contract grading?
      
      Joe: Similar to what Sarah said earlier, this part of the book, the retrofitting part especially, which is on page 33 of the book really made me— articulated issues that I had felt, but never really been able to put words on when I first started using contracts in 2021. When I think of what Dolmage is saying here, I also am reminded of what Jacob said earlier about neoliberal conditions and the fact that sometimes grading contracts can seem like a precursor to an employment situation, and I know that oftentimes as college instructors we feel a desire to prepare students for the work world. Sometimes that's a good thing. I don't think it's always a good thing. Why are we uncomfortable with proactivity when it comes to issues of ability? Uh, to me, and I'm only pontificating here, it has to do with what we were just talking about: we tend to see a college classroom as kind of a preparation for a capitalist system, and the idea that we would alter time, or responsibility, or how students labor because of the fact that there are neurodivergent students in our classrooms, that there are mental health issues, and that there are students from different socioeconomic backgrounds, I think is really uncomfortable to a lot of us. And that is something I felt early on using contracts, especially my first semester when I used Inoue’s contract pretty much exactly as he writes about it in his book Labor-Based Grading Contracts in a Compassionate Writing Classroom. And so I think that's an uncomfortable reality to sit with, and one we're really gonna have to see more research on in the future.
      
      Sarah: Yes, I absolutely agree. And I wanted to add something because I have to come clean: I have a confession. I used to be the queen of retrofitting. I'm not proud of it, but that is the reality. The reason for that is because I was using a contract that was similar to Inoue’s contract with very strict deadlines, very strict attendance policies, and so there was constant stress on the part of the students and myself to make this contract work along with the reality of their lives, right? It didn't work. So I had a very strict contract and then a thousand side deals with students— long email exchanges, long office hours, conversations on how to make it work, right? And so it was a huge amount of work for me and stress trying to keep track of all these individual accommodations that I would make on the spot, right? So I find that fascinating, that retrofitting is not just wrong because it's asking students to disclose their disabilities or to explain their life emergencies to us, but it's also a huge amount of labor on the part of the instructor, right? So since I moved to a flexible contract, my student’s life is easier, but mine as well. So again, I really love this idea that when we center a disability in the classroom, everyone's life is better.
      `;
    } else if (title === 'Chapters 4 and 5') {
      document.getElementById("chapterText").innerHTML = `Sarah: Chapter 4, “Labor-Based Contract Grading and Students’ Intersectional Identities,” warns that labor contracts can end up being inequitable towards the students of color they’re actually meant to support, right? One of the ways that they create inequity is by ignoring the intersectionality of students. For example, while the goal of labor contracts is to be anti-racist, Carillo points out that Black students are more likely to have a disability (and very often an undiagnosed disability or a racially-biased diagnosed one) and thus the students are disadvantaged with contracts that reward normative standards of labor. Even worse, these normative standards of labor become a substitute for quality when we ask our students to labor more to improve their work, again, showing that we have a very specific idea of what that final product needs to look like, and we use labor to have the students reach it. And this to me is one of the most thought-provoking chapters because it's a great demonstration of how Disability Studies lenses can help us notice ignored issues in our assessment methods.
      
      The next chapter also demonstrates this, but this time Carillo is looking at the ableist assumptions in the research about contract grading. In Chapter 5, “The Effectiveness of Labor-Based Grading Contracts,” Carillo reviews the existing research on contracts. It is a quick review because, as Carillo points out, we need a lot more research on this assessment method. But what's worse is that the few studies on contract grading do not focus on disabilities, again showing the tendency of imagining our students as non-disabled. Carillo reviews some of the negative results found by some researchers, notably the resistance and dislike students can experience towards this form of assessment, and she wonders if it might be due to the fact that labor-based contracts declare themselves to be equitable, when in fact they're not. This is illustrated in Inoue’s 2019 study where black students labor more for lower grades, thus highlighting that this assessment system has not yet resolved racial inequalities — even though we have ascribed onto labor-based contracts, an imaginary automatic ability to level the playing field.
      
      Chapters 4 and 5 are tough on those of us who thought we had solved all of our problems with assessment by switching to labor contracts, I'm definitely one of those persons; I thought everything was good, now I didn't have to think anymore about assessment. I was done. So these chapters were a really good, wake-up call. But there was also an exhilarating effect that comes from reading them because once the assumptions are out in the open and made evident, we can do something about them. We can fix them, we can change the contracts. And so there was, uh, yeah, really exhilaration of getting back to work and getting back to square one and rethinking my contract. I wonder if you experienced this exhilaration, too, when you read these chapters?
      
Jacob: Yeah, Sarah, I think for me, what I— well, it's what I love about this book, but I think it's simultaneously the biggest strength and the biggest weakness about this book, and I think that's dependent upon who you are as an audience member. If you were somebody who is just entering this conversation about alternative assessment and you haven't done labor-based grading contracts and you're looking for, like a how-to-do-this-at-my-institution guide, then this might be a weakness that Carrillo leaves her conceptualization kind of open, right? It's open for interpretation for you as an individual; it's more about thinking about these things and recognizing there are all these different moving parts that we need to consider that often our scholarship about contract grades has not considered in publications, but it's also a super strength, I think, because if you're somebody like us who's been interested in alternative assessment, who's been doing alternative assessment with grading contracts it makes it so we're like, “I already have a general idea, but now I can take this information that Carillo is providing in this book and apply it holistically to my contract grades and the way that I'm conceiving of that aspect of assessment.” I think there's an inherent level of flexibility, as opposed to her providing some very strict model that you have to follow. Right? It's all about context. What it— what works for Asao is great, right? It works at his institution, it works with his students, and it works for his pedagogy. And I think it's important to note that Carrillo is not attacking Asao’s work; it's just building upon it. And one of those key takeaways is: what works for others isn't always going to work for you. It depends on what state you're in, it depends on what rank you have within an institution, and it depends on what school you have and the departmental support as well. So for me, like, it is a strength. It might also leave some people wanting more if they need that level of— kind of guidance. And I think that just is something for potential readers to keep in mind before coming to this book.

Joe: I agree. Since I've been using contracts for a while and I'm reading a lot of research, to me that was a strength that she doesn't prescribe what I should do next in light of the issues she raises. Was it exhilarating the first time I read it? No, I was not exhilarated. I was a bit, uh— And I think that's also— I'm not cognitively confused, but just maybe emotionally confused on what I was supposed to do next. This book required a couple more readings and it's why it's great to have conversations about books like this because, Sarah, when I read in our notes for this production that you found it exhilarating then I also found it exhilarating actually on hearing that you were exhilarated by it because, um, it does like I said earlier, highlight issues that I had felt but never been able to articulate. A couple things I wanna point out is that this book— in these chapters that you summarized for us, Sarah, reminded me of Dr. Michelle Cowan’s article, “The Legacy of Grading Contracts,” because it provides a broad overview of some of the research that's out there. And there is a lack of empirical studies on the efficacy of grading contracts. But there are some, and one that I found really important that I think Carillo really draws from, especially in Chapter 4, is Kryger and Zimmerman, and they're talking about intersectionality in and ability in labor-based grading contracts. And I recommend that article, if anybody wants to know more about kind of the inspiration I feel that Carillo drew from in writing this book. I think a lot of it probably came from Kryger/Zimmerman, and I appreciate the way Carillo really amplifies that research. And one thing that I want to know more about after reading these chapters is something that— I guess you could say it's a drawback of Carillo’s book or maybe just an opportunity for further research, is the impact of social class on labor-based grading contracts. She alludes to it here and there. But I think that's a huge area for further research is how, you know, when students have to go to work, when they have to pay for their own education out of pocket, as they're in the middle of college, that has to impact their ability to labor.

Sarah: I agree. We can call the research right now, right? Use this opportunity to call for more research in the social class and in contract grading. Absolutely."
      `;
    } else if (title === 'Chapter 6') {
      document.getElementById("chapterText").innerHTML = `Joe: Okay. So the final chapter is called “Forging Ahead,” and she says here that a shift from labor to engagement, as the standard by which we are determining final course grades might be a “more flexible” strategy (57). An engagement-based grading contract offers “a range of ways a student might interact with the course” that the students can choose from (ibid.). Following Wood, she says “we need a paradigmatic shift in the way we construct time for our students” (59). ‘In the way we construct time for our students’… that's a challenge, right? As Woods says, “students' anxiety might be alleviated through cripping time, increasing flexibility, avoiding rigidity, and lowering the stakes of writing, (particularly in the beginning stages of a course)” (ibid.). The other strategy she suggests besides shifting the way we construct time for students, is to do individualized contracts where students share their goals and you contract with students based on that. It's kind of a start-from-scratch approach that really lets students in on the creation of the contract. My question for you two is do these strategies seem feasible? Are there other ways to uncouple willingness from ability?
      
      Sarah: So to answer the question on feasibility, I think it's really important to think about our institutional context in a student population before we make decisions about strategies. So for example, I teach upper division courses in a 10-week quarter to seniors who are ready to graduate. They're graduating basically after my class, right? Asking them at that point to come up with an individual contract super quickly because we are rushing through the assignments in those 10 weeks… I haven't figured out how to make that happen in a way that wouldn't be, at worst, a really huge source of stress for them, at best, a source of frustration. So I've stayed away from individualized contracts for that student population. Instead, what I've done is create a very flexible contract so that students can come up with their own ways to complete the work. Kind of like a choose-your-own-adventure-possibility-of-learning-and-completing-tasks which I think fits well with that population because it allows them to fit their learning goals and their graduation goals to what we're doing in the class. Carillo brings up flexibility, right, as one of the strategies and I think more than the detailed strategies of talking about discussion boards and you know, all kinds of examples that are brought up in the book — I think that flexibility is really key here. To me, it's what changes, things in the class, what changes things for a contract.
      
      Jacob: Yeah, and Joe, you mentioned the strategy of individualizing contracts with students, right? And as rhet/comp people, we see this as kind of a democratization of the classroom and there's benefit there. And it really makes me think of the article “Negotiating Authority by Designing Individualized Grading Contracts” by Nathan Brubaker from 2010. In that article, which I think really kind of set the intellectual ground for this sort of thing, Brubaker discusses this research, with 22 undergraduate students, designing grading contracts individualized for them. I think this is kind of a pie-in-the-sky sort of thing. It certainly is ideal. It's a best situation to be able to individualize with each student how they're to be assessed. And we see a similar thing in a lot of ungrading scholarship where students select their criteria that they will be judged on for themselves in a specific course. But then we get to the question of feasibility. It's one thing to be doing this in a single section with 22 students who may be upper division. It's a different story if you are contingent labor and you're teaching a 4/4 or a 4/5 or a 5/5, and you've got 120 students that you are supposed to be individualizing grading contracts on. Metacognitively, what does that do in terms of feedback for assignments or like grading assignments or, you know, understanding a student's growth and progress throughout the course of a semester when every single student has an individualized [contract], right? So there's some give-and-take between, maybe an overwhelming amount of, individualization and “we can allow some like class-to-class” based individualization pragmatically, right? Like, I think these are— it's an ideal, we should strive toward this sort of thing. But again, it really does go back to your pedagogy, your institution, your rank. Um, and I think that as long as we're thinking through these things and considering them and the way that we're implementing grading contracts, we're headed in the right direction, at the very least.
      
      Joe: I agree. I agree wholeheartedly on those comments about the individualization of contracts. Which brings us back to the other suggestion, which is flexibility, and I don't know if there's a whole— I'm not aware of research on what it means to be a flexible instructor in college. I want to know more about what that is, what students perceive that as, as to be and what faculty perceive that to be. I go back to what we were talking about earlier about neoliberalism. I think we're uncomfortable with talking about flexibility 'cause it challenges notions of work and what it means to be a responsible adult in the United States. Let's be clear. To me it means flexible due dates. It means not… it means not holding students to it. You know, getting your paper in on time, all at the same time, right? At the same time, we can't just have papers trickling in throughout the semester 'cause we have our own workloads to manage. So do y'all have any ideas about how we can actually practice flexibility? Besides, you know, flexible due dates? Or how does this work with attendance policies?
      
      Jacob: I think that's a good connection there to kind of the broader call that Carrillo makes about uncoupling willingness from ability or participation from a willingness to participate. And I don't have an answer for it, and I don't think that Carrillo really has an answer for it either. Reading the book, I think it's super thought-provoking and it definitely is a direction to go in terms of research. I would love to see in the next couple years somebody piloting a grading contract that is considering willingness to participate. I think a first step is accessibility in terms of flexibility, right? Instead of thinking about participation only as in-class discussion, especially with disabled or neurodivergent students, an option could be to allow, like, alternative participation in a digital space. So if students are uncomfortable speaking in front of a class, instead they might be willing to post their thoughts on a discussion board, on a learning management system. And we're still— they're still engaging with the course, they're still participating, but it's in an environment that maybe is a non-traditional manner. I think there's still issues with that, right, because it does require labor. It still requires students to do it in a textual way, so we could open that up into maybe multimodal avenues and I think that would be an interesting route to take. But I am not confident in my expertise to, like, make any broad suggestions. I think it's— as a field, we need to continue to investigate how we can reconceive of participation, how we can accommodate non-standard modes of participation, and how we can eventually incorporate that into our practices of flexibility.
      
      Sarah: I agree, and one of the main things that I got from this book is the focus on creating a contract based on engagement. My contract is now an engagement-based contract where I ask students to explain how they've engaged in the class, how they've engaged with the material, how they've engaged with the assignments. It's not quite an individualized contract. There is one contract, but there are multiple ways to interpret it. And so it's bringing in flexibility back into the conversation here of allowing students to have this contract, interpret it, and then explain how they've interpreted and how they've met the goals, the tasks that were listed.I think that this switch to engagement seems so tiny. It's a simple thing. It's quite revolutionary because it really breaks up a normative standard on ability. It's removing our authority, our control over the students. It allows students to find their own ways to learn and think critically and complete the work. And then it allows us to learn from our students. Because we are seeing our students are doing things differently, which means that we are learning too, which is great 'cause we're not in the classroom just to teach. Right? And so it's again, just a tiny switch and you have a revolution.
      
      Joe: I really like that. I tried calling mine an engagement-based grading contract a few semesters ago, and I found it very difficult to… not quantify, but just gather evidence of engagement. But I feel, Sarah, like your reflective writing from your students, it does serve as evidence of engagement and reminds me of ungrading philosophy in a sense. Lemme tell you what I've done this semester in light of Carillo. It's basically still calling mine a labor-based grading contract because at the end of the day, we are always asking our students to labor. What this book is suggesting is that we just trouble, challenge, complicate what we mean by labor and who we are centering— what kind of laboring body we're centering our contract around. So when it comes to attendance, I have flexible, vague guidelines, which actually is an idea I got from you, Sarah, about attendance. You know, uh, folks who get B’s tend to show up in class. “Do I even know you? Have I seen you?” You know, we get a chance to talk about that throughout the semester. And when it comes to assignments, yeah, there are due dates but in the contract, what does a student with a B do? They tend to turn things in on time. It's leaving room for negotiation with the student about whether or not they— how they feel about how they met that vague guideline, which I can— which sacrifices objectivity, I feel, for negotiation, which the hegemonic idea of education that I came into teaching with says that “we do not negotiate with students, negotiation is bad.” This flips that on its head and says, “negotiation is good.” And it's not the typical negotiation of “why did I get a 98? I want those final two points.” It's a negotiation of “am I laboring in ways that I can labor taking into account my— you know, the way my brain works or the time I have with regards to my job or, you know, taking care of my sick grandmother and things like that.” So Sarah, I'll let you know how that goes and you let me know how yours goes. And Jacob, you let me know how yours goes. We'll continue this conversation.What else would everyone like to say about this book before we end?
      
      Sarah: Just the idea that assessment is a process, and we are never done, which I've learned my lesson— when I switched to labor contracts, I thought I was done. And Carillo’s book really showed me you will never be done. You will keep talking about and thinking about assessment throughout your career. It never stops. So that's really a gem that I got from the book and I really appreciate that insight.
      
      Jacob: And I think this is more of just a matter-of-fact thing, but one of the bits I appreciated about the book was that it's relatively short. It's, like, about 70 pages, so it's not a very long book, but there's a lot condensed into it. So it makes it maybe more approachable than something that's 400 pages, but you're still walking away feeling like maybe you've had, like a crash course in considering disability studies and assessment. And if that's the first time that you've had that crash course, I think it's really impactful.
